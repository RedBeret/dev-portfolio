  "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Software Engineer with a rich Systems Engineering background, adept in JavaScript, Python, React, and Agile methodologies. My professional journey is distinguished by leading over 50 US Navy ship IT system integrations, demonstrating my capability in managing complex projects and collaborative engineering efforts. Transitioning from systems to software engineering, I've focused on development, testing, and optimizing solutions, validated by industry-recognized certifications in SEC+, CCNA, DASM, and AWS. My eligibility to work on sensitive and classified projects has been assessed and approved, reflecting my commitment to integrity and high standards of security. Outside of my professional pursuits, I'm an avid world traveler and solo adventurer, drawing inspiration from diverse cultures and landscapesâ€”from the historic streets of Berlin and Rome to the amazing views of Lake Como and the Swiss Alps. These experiences have not only broadened my perspective but also infused my software development approach with creativity, adaptability, and a global outlook. Currently, I'm channeling my passion for technology and exploration from my base in San Diego, California, eager to tackle new challenges and innovate within the dynamic field of software engineering.",
