# My Portfolio

This portfolio is built upon a fantastic template provided by [Dorota1997](https://github.com/Dorota1997/react-frontend-dev-portfolio). The template offers a sleek, responsive design that's easy to customize and deploy, making it an ideal starting point for showcasing my software development projects and skills.

- **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across various devices.
- **Light/Dark Mode:** Gives visitors the flexibility to choose their preferred theme.
- **Dynamically Fetched Data:** Content is loaded from JSON files, enabling easy updates.

## Custom Enhancements

While the original template laid a solid foundation, I've introduced several enhancements to tailor the portfolio to my professional identity and personal taste:

- **Theme-Dependent Slider and Typewriter:** Replaced React Typical with React Simple Typewriter for a more dynamic presentation of my roles and skills. Integrated a theme-dependent slider that toggles between frontend and backend technologies based on the selected theme (light or dark), visually representing my diverse skill set with appropriate icons.
- **Second Language Addition:** Expanded the multilingual functionality to include [your language], broadening the portfolio's accessibility.
- **Security and Code Upgrades:** Updated software dependencies to reduce vulnerabilities and refine the codebase for better performance and security.
