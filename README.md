# Dev Portfolio

This portfolio is built upon a great template provided by [Dorota1997](https://github.com/Dorota1997/react-frontend-dev-portfolio). As a dev had to standup a portfolio within a day so used this and made some personal touch improvements. Planning on adding blog api to it as well then when it is up and running customize my own and transfer components to that. The template offers a sleek, responsive design that's easy to customize and deploy, making it an ideal starting point for showcasing software development projects and skills.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support:** Allows showcasing my portfolio in different languages.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across various devices.
- **Light/Dark Mode:** Gives visitors the flexibility to choose their preferred theme.
- **Dynamically Fetched Data:** Content is loaded from JSON files, enabling easy updates.
- **Minimalistic and Expandable:** Clean design with room to grow.

## Custom Enhancements

While the original template laid a solid foundation, I've introduced several enhancements to tailor the portfolio to my professional identity and personal taste:

- **Theme-Dependent Slider and Typewriter:** Replaced React Typical with React Simple Typewriter for a more dynamic presentation of my roles and skills. Integrated a theme-dependent slider that toggles between frontend and backend technologies based on the selected theme (light or dark), visually representing my diverse skill set with appropriate icons.
- **Second Language Addition:** Expanded the multilingual functionality to include [your language], broadening the portfolio's accessibility.
- **Security and Code Upgrades:** Updated software dependencies to reduce vulnerabilities and refine the codebase for better performance and security.
- **Blog Integration**: Added a section to dynamically display the latest blog posts, keeping the portfolio updated with current thought leadership and insights.
- **Leadership Focused Recommendation**: Incorporated feedback highlighting my leadership approach, emphasizing my capability to elevate team performance and project efficiency through proactive mentorship and leveraging individual strengths.
